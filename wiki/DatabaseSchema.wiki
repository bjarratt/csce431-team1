= Introduction =

This preliminary database schema should allow for implementation of all use cases currently specified.


= Tables =
 * All tables implicitly have an ID column not mentioned in this document. This column will have the specification: INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT, and most likely will be named ModelNameID, or simply ID.

 * Relationships between tables are represented in this document by the terms has_many, has_one, and belongs_to, which are used similarly to their meaning in Ruby on Rails. TODO: Add documentation of the meaning (and actual implementation) of these relationship verbs.
